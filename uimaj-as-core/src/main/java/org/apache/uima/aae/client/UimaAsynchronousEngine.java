/**
 * A <code>UimaAsynchronousEngine</code> enables an application to send CASes for analysis to remote
 * UIMA AS service. It provides a high level API and hides the detail of the transport
 * implementation. The UIMA AS Client implementation uses JMS as its transport mechanism. Both
 * synchronous and asynchronous processing is supported. For synchronous processing an application
 * should call {@link #sendAndReceiveCAS(CAS)} method. For asynchronous processing the application
 * should call {@link #sendCAS(CAS)} method. Additionally, processing with a client side
 * <code>CollectionReader</code> is supported as well. The application first instantiates and
 * initializes the <code>CollectionReader</code> and registers it via
 * {@link #setCollectionReader(CollectionReader)} method. Once the <code>CollectionReader</code> is
 * registered, and {@link #initialize(Map)} method is called, the application may call
 * {@link #process()} method.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This API enables the application to dynamically deploy UIMA AS services that it intends to use
 * for processing. These services are deployed in a container and are collocated in the same JVM as
 * the application. The services are considered private and used exclusively by the application. To
 * deploy "private" services the application calls either {@link #deploy(String, Map)}
 * {@link #deploy(String[], Map)} method, where the first parameter is either a single AS deployment
 * descriptor or an array thereof. The application must deploy its "private" services *before*
 * calling {@link #initialize(Map)} method.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The application may stop the UIMA AS client in the middle of processing by calling
 * {@link #stop()} method.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Listeners can register with the <code>UimaAsynchronousEngine</code> by calling the
 * {@link #addStatusCallbackListener(UimaAsBaseCallbackListener)} method. These listeners receive
 * status callbacks during the processing. An exception to that is the synchronous processing via
 * {@link #sendAndReceiveCAS(CAS)} method. This method returns either a CAS containing results of
 * analysis or an exception. No callbacks are made while processing CASes synchronously.
 * <p>
 * An application may choose to implement parallelization of the processing, calling either
 * {@link #sendAndReceiveCAS(CAS)} or {@link #sendCAS(CAS)} methods from multiple threads.
 * <p>
